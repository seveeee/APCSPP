	<p style="font-size:50px" style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS'">  This year I played on the Varsity baseball team as a pitcher. I didn't expect much out of the season, but as time when on I got an increasingly bigger role within the pitchiting rotation. This taught me about perseverance and was a really fun experience. </p>

           <p style="font-size:50px" style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS'"> This year I started to play the Piano again. I used to play the piano a long time ago, so I decided to give it another shot. I first started easy, and then slowly began improving. While I'm not too great it doesn't sound too bad!</p>
