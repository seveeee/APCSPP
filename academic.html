	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">This year I took a lot of fun but difficult classes! I took AP CSP this year and it was my first time truly learning to code, I started to master  Python! I also had AP US History, this class was very difficult because it relied on memorization and writing, two skills I did not really have at the start of the year. But I perservered and learned alot. I learned more Spanish and practiced my writing in English class, learning more about myself and the world. Finally I took Physics and Calculus, these two math reliant classes were a little difficult as they pushed my math limits to the max. I really enjoyed both classes getting a better understanding of calculus and understanding the universe in it's entirety. </p>
